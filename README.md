### Eris Reborn

I made this project initially as a continuation of RockESV's Eris theme, as it wasn't receiving updates for a long time. So, I decided to update the theme myself. Since then, RockESV has updated his theme a bit and changed some stuff. I personally don't like some of the features, so I decided to change some of it to be more to my liking.

Huge thanks to [RockESV](https://github.com/RockESV) for creating the original Eris theme! Without his work, this theme wouldn't exist.
